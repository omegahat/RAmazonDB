Package: RAmazonDBREST
Title: REST-based Interface to Amazon's SimpleDB
Description: This is an R package that provides an 
 interface to (some of) Amazon's SimpleDB engine
 to create, populate, access and generally manipulate
 databases.
Note: This initial version is mostly functional but
  is released in the hope that those who want to use
  it will provide suggestions and offer code to improve its
  functionality.
  We will probably implement a similar interface but using SOAP.
  This is more structured and avoids a lot of URL escaping issues.
  Also, we will add higher-level R-like facilities to this 
  that layer on top of the basic interface and possibly
  include R type information and attributes to amazon tables
  and also allows us to treat remote tables virtually as
  regular data frames.
